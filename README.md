# HouseCut
Software Engineering I project for Fall 2016.

A project for my software engineering course, Housecut is a roommate management application for android. 
It allows roommates to manage their chores, grocery lists, and other general tasks to help foster 
a better, healthy communication between themselves.

It currently requires a local server to be run.

This application was developed in Android Studio.
